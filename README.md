## Case Study Introduction: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

This case study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone unit.
As described in the Google Sara Analytics Professional Certificate, this case study will follow the 6 steps of the Data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act. 
The aforementioned steps were all accomplished by using Rstudio. 

### Scenario

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

### Goal

Driving question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Cyclistic Bike-Share wants to increase member subscriptions for their services because annual members are more profitable than casual riders. Therefore they would like to know how member and casual riders use Cyclistic services differently. The results from this analysis may be used to guide future marketing programs to increase member subscriptions.

## STEP 1 : Ask

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

**This case study focuses on the first question.** 

The key tasks of this first step are the following:
* Identify the business task: analysing the difference in  usage patterns of casual riders and annualm members with the aim to convert casual riders into annual members
* Consider key stakeholders like the **director of marketing**, responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-sharing program, and the **Cyclistic's executive team**, which decides weather to approve the recommended marketing program.
